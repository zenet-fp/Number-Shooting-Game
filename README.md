# Number Shooting Game

Welcome, this project of mine actually was inspired by a space shooting game from back in the days, this code is not complete and doesn't give justice to the game properly, but it is merely an attempt by a computer scientist named Zenet. 

## Aim Of The Game

Use the numbers and operations given to you to create expressions that evaluate to target numbers. For every correct match, your score increases — but guess wrong, and your score drops. If you fall to -3, it's game over.
You may choose your own difficulty from: easy to hard.
